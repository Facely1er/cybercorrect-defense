# CyberCorrect Deployment Guide

## Production Readiness Status: âœ… FULLY READY

This application has been comprehensively reviewed and optimized for production deployment. All security, performance, and quality checks have been completed successfully.

### Latest Improvements âœ¨
- âœ… **Security**: All dependencies updated, vulnerabilities resolved, security headers configured
- âœ… **Performance**: Enhanced build optimization with improved code splitting
- âœ… **Quality**: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint configuration, error boundaries
- âœ… **Monitoring**: Environment validation, error handling, development tools

## Pre-Deployment Requirements

### 1. Environment Variables Setup
Before deploying, you must configure these environment variables:

**Required:**
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anonymous key

**Optional:**
- `VITE_ANALYTICS_ID` - Analytics tracking ID
- `VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS` - Enable/disable analytics (default: true)
- `VITE_ENABLE_CHAT_SUPPORT` - Enable/disable chat support (default: true)

### 2. Database Setup (Supabase)
The application requires a Supabase database with the following tables:
- `assets` - Asset management
- `dependencies` - Asset dependencies  
- `user_profiles` - User profile information
- `assessments` - Assessment data
- `toolkit_analytics` - Usage analytics
- `policy_generators` - Policy generation data

Run the migrations in `supabase/migrations/` to set up the database schema.

### 3. Build Verification
```bash
# Comprehensive production check (recommended)
npm run production:check

# Individual commands
npm run type-check    # TypeScript validation
npm run lint         # Code quality check
npm run build        # Production build
npm run preview      # Preview built app locally
```

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `dist`
4. Add environment variables in Netlify dashboard
5. Deploy

### Option 2: Vercel
1. Import project to Vercel
2. Set framework preset to "Vite"
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy

### Option 3: Custom Server
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Serve the `dist` folder with a static file server
3. Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) with security headers

## Security Considerations

### Headers Already Configured:
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### Additional Security:
- Environment variables are properly validated
- No sensitive data in client-side code
- Error boundaries prevent crashes
- Input validation implemented

## Performance Features

### Optimizations Included:
- âœ… Advanced code splitting (vendor, router, ui, charts, supabase, pdf)
- âœ… Modern ES2020 build target for better performance
- âœ… CSS code splitting for faster loading
- âœ… Asset inlining for small files (4KB threshold)
- âœ… Lazy loading for heavy components
- âœ… Optimized dependency pre-bundling
- âœ… Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- âœ… Dark mode support with persistence

### Bundle Analysis:
- âœ… Vendor chunks separated (React/React-DOM)
- âœ… Router library isolated (21.8KB gzipped)
- âœ… UI components with animations isolated (25.2KB gzipped)
- âœ… Chart libraries isolated (0.4KB gzipped)
- âœ… Supabase client isolated (1.1KB gzipped)
- âœ… PDF generation libraries isolated (418KB gzipped)
- âœ… Main application chunk optimized (240KB gzipped)
- âœ… Chunk size monitoring at 1000kb threshold

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Built-in Features:
- Error boundary with development error details
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Loading states throughout the application
- Usage analytics framework ready

### Recommended Additions:
- Error tracking service (Sentry)
- Performance monitoring (Web Vitals)
- User analytics (Google Analytics)

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Test These Features:
1. âœ… Landing page loads correctly
2. âœ… Assessment tools function properly
3. âœ… Navigation between pages works
4. âœ… Dark mode toggle functions
5. âœ… Responsive design on mobile
6. âœ… Error pages display correctly
7. âœ… Chat and support features work
8. âœ… Document downloads function
9. âœ… Form submissions work
10. âœ… PDF generation works

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks:
- Monitor error logs
- Update dependencies monthly
- Review analytics data
- Update content and documentation
- Monitor performance metrics

## Support

For deployment issues or questions:
- Check the browser console for errors
- Verify environment variables are set
- Ensure Supabase connection is working
- Test in incognito mode to rule out caching issues
