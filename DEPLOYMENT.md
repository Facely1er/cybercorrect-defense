# CyberCorrect Deployment Guide

## Production Readiness Status: âœ… READY

This application is ready for production deployment with proper security, performance optimizations, and error handling.

## Pre-Deployment Requirements

### 1. Environment Variables Setup
Before deploying, you must configure these environment variables:

**Required:**
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anonymous key

**Optional:**
- `VITE_ANALYTICS_ID` - Analytics tracking ID
- `VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS` - Enable/disable analytics (default: true)
- `VITE_ENABLE_CHAT_SUPPORT` - Enable/disable chat support (default: true)

### 2. Database Setup (Supabase)
The application requires a Supabase database with the following tables:
- `assets` - Asset management
- `dependencies` - Asset dependencies  
- `user_profiles` - User profile information
- `assessments` - Assessment data
- `toolkit_analytics` - Usage analytics
- `policy_generators` - Policy generation data

Run the migrations in `supabase/migrations/` to set up the database schema.

### 3. Build Verification
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `dist`
4. Add environment variables in Netlify dashboard
5. Deploy

### Option 2: Vercel
1. Import project to Vercel
2. Set framework preset to "Vite"
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy

### Option 3: Custom Server
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Serve the `dist` folder with a static file server
3. Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) with security headers

## Security Considerations

### Headers Already Configured:
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### Additional Security:
- Environment variables are properly validated
- No sensitive data in client-side code
- Error boundaries prevent crashes
- Input validation implemented

## Performance Features

### Optimizations Included:
- Code splitting by route and feature
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Image optimization suggestions
- Responsive design
- Dark mode support with persistence

### Bundle Analysis:
- Vendor chunks separated
- Router, UI, and chart libraries isolated
- Chunk size warning at 1000kb

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Built-in Features:
- Error boundary with development error details
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Loading states throughout the application
- Usage analytics framework ready

### Recommended Additions:
- Error tracking service (Sentry)
- Performance monitoring (Web Vitals)
- User analytics (Google Analytics)

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Test These Features:
1. âœ… Landing page loads correctly
2. âœ… Assessment tools function properly
3. âœ… Navigation between pages works
4. âœ… Dark mode toggle functions
5. âœ… Responsive design on mobile
6. âœ… Error pages display correctly
7. âœ… Chat and support features work
8. âœ… Document downloads function
9. âœ… Form submissions work
10. âœ… PDF generation works

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks:
- Monitor error logs
- Update dependencies monthly
- Review analytics data
- Update content and documentation
- Monitor performance metrics

## Support

For deployment issues or questions:
- Check the browser console for errors
- Verify environment variables are set
- Ensure Supabase connection is working
- Test in incognito mode to rule out caching issues
